# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Overview

The project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia-positive or negative with high accuracy. The model achieves an accuracy of 92.6%.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model implementation using TensorFlow and Keras
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis and visualization

## Requirements
